Using DuckDuckGo for the words "android games that can be played by 3 or more players" I get information by:
1️⃣ www.androidauthority.com
and we got a game owned by Gameloft which is owned by "Vivendi SE"(publicly traded company?) which is owned at a 27% share by Bolloré SE.
Wow what a jungle!

Let's just say that these aren't games on GitHub and looking at the androidauthority article I just realized, why don't we just make games
here on GitHub to solve this jungle and people get the code and we are all happy!

Ok, research done for today and now feeling more motivated to contribute code/ideas to GitHub. GO GO GO!
